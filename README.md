# Cosmic-Encyclopaedia-Index
Host of the CEI Archives 
The rules of the CEI are as follows.
1. All submissions must be personal works without the assistance of AI generation tools of any kind.
2. Always try to further expand on yet to be connected links. If you see a red link in someones work, prioritise it over making new unconnected works.
3. Every article must always have links to a minimum of three other articles.
4. Every article may only have a maximum of three links to uncreated other articles when written.
   eg. If you create an article under the letter D with five links in it to other ideas/articles, A maximum of three of them can be as yet uncreated articles.
5. Write from the perspective of a character. You can have multiple characters, as long as they make sense to the world building. If they dont yet, make an article that fixes this.
6. When you create a new article, update the Index with it, then update the index with any new uncreated links that you havve included in your article.
7. There are no higher intelligent life forms outside of human origin. No parralel evolution or alt humanity.
8. Do not write articles for links that you created in other articles. Always work
